# Breadth First Search Algorithm 

Learning about queue, stack other data stuctures, as well as graphs and tree traversal to slove the shorthest path algorithm. For this algoritm I created 9 nodes which were all connect with atleast another node and the purpose of this task was to one day to build on to BFS algorithm using google maps to find the out the longest distance that can be reach from Wellington Airport in 2 or 3 international flights.
